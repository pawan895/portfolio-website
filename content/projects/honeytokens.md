The Honeytoken Project is a cybersecurity initiative designed to detect and analyze potential security threats by deploying fake access tokens, known as honeytokens, in strategic locations. By monitoring the use of these honeytokens, you can gain insights into the behavior of potential attackers and enhance your organization's security posture.
